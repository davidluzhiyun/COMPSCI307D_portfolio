# Journal : Improvement Reflection

## Habits

* Some to keep
  * Using gitlab to manage versions
  * Write tests for my code
  * Have classes interact with interface
  * Control access to classes and methods

* Some not worth keeping
  * Having very short classes that spread all over the place is something I might not continue
  beyond the class since it sometimes make my code hard to understand. But I will design my classes
  to be more active.

* Some to explore later
  * Pipeline is something I still need to explore later. I am not familiar with it since it is just
  introduced.
  * Another thing I need to explore later is test-driven development. As of now, I haven't explored
  it yet

* Value of checklists?
  * Yes. I will continue to use them. It is not easy to keep all the design rules in mind all the
  time.

## Programming Skills

* Delightful code
  * The browser example delighted me It is my first introduction into using resource bundles

* Lessons from worst coding experience
  * My worst coding experience was trying to refactor my code for oolala project. The lesson I have
  learned is that keeping my code clean from the beginning might be easier than refactoring later.
* Lessons from best coding experience
  * My best coding experience is building my alternative model classes for the cell society. I kept
  my code clean and tested. I intentionally controlled the information classes can access. The only
  problem was the lack of communication between teammates.

* Interesting skills beyond coding
  * I am developing some aptitude for the overall design of the model part.


## Personal

* Personal strengths
  * I didn't have much of a personal strength before the class since haven't taken may COMPSCI
  courses. This course help me find some strengths in designing.

* Personal weaknesses
  * Previously I often struggle to write clean code and often end up with overly long methods. This
  course helped change that.

* Communication and empathy
  * This course exposed the reason why my previous teamwork often fails when the team contains more
  than two people. I found that I become reluctant to voice my own opinion or interfere with
  problematic team decisions when the team gets large. I am also bad at listening when there is a
  large team. I am changing that by being more active in meetings for my final project.

* Personal development steps
  * I would take part in more personal projects where I can keep improving on skills I developed in
  this class.
