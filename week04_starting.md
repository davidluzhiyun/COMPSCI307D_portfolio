## Starting a Big Project

### First design challenge
The first challenge our team chose to work on is to split the OOLALA project into
Manageable chunks. Since our team adjust our workflow with trello.

### First piece of code
The first piece of code our team chose to work on is the turtle class. We made the
choice because it is relatively independent of the rest of the code.
### Hardest part or biggest obstacle
As of now the biggest obstacle is to figure out how GUI works. Since some other members
are already working on the turtle class, my part of the job will definitely involve 
operations I am unfamiliar with.

### First coding session insights
I am yet to start on coding for the project.

### Successful outcome
Our team makes a turtle IDE with most of the working features and is relatively easy
to building on thanks to good refactoring.

### Worst possible outcome
We build an incoherent mess that doesn't work at all due to collaboration breakdown.
