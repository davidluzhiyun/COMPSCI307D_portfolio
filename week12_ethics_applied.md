## Scenario #1

### If you do not have any ethical concerns as presented, what change to the scenario would create issue(s)?


### How would handle the ethical issues in the situation?
1/100 is a very high enough rate in terms of plurality voting. I would speak out to my manager based
on pre-rehearsed line. I will appeal to them based on two grounds. First, the product's defect can
have serious outcomes because it is integrated into the infrastructure. Second, providing the 
defective voting machine to the government might negatively affect the company's reputation and
future contracts.

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)


* 1.2 Avoid harm.
  * Defective machines might harm the democratic process
* 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.
  * Speaking out to my superiors is being honest and trustworthy


* 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
  * If the company releases the voting machine without fixing the issue, they violate this rule.
* 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
  * I need to review the code of the voting machine if the company decide to delay the release.
* 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.
  * The voting machine now is defective and can't be considered secure.

* 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.
  * The voting machine the company makes is integrated into the infrastructure of society. Extra care
  must be taken to make sure it isn't skewed.

### Useful GVV Pillars (and why)

* Purpose
  * By bringing up I am a programmer working on the project and therefore responsible for pointing 
  out the problems is a useful argument.
* Voice
  * I need to report the defect to my superiors.
* Reasons & Rationalizations
  * By reasoning from both an ethical perspective and from how it may affect the company, I can make
  my voice more persuasive.

## Scenario #2

### If you do not have any ethical concerns as presented, what change to the scenario would create issue(s)?
If the code is from a codebase that specifically states that no commercial use is allowed. 

### How would handle the ethical issues in the situation?
First, I would inform the managers about the complexity of the problem and the time might not be
enough. Then I will use the fragment of code I found and attribute the codebase in my comment and
documentations like my colleague did.

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)


* 1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
  * If the managers insist on the deadline, they might be violating this rule. If I am using code
  fragment from a source I shouldn't use, I am violating this code.

* 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
  * If the managers insist on the deadline due to underestimating the complexity of the problem, 
  they might be violating this rule.

### Useful GVV Pillars (and why)

* Voice
  * I need to communicate with the management about the complexity of the problem.
* Reasons & Rationalizations
  * listing the technical issues I will face can make the above argument more persuasive.
