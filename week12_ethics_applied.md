## Scenario #1

### If you do not have any ethical concerns as presented, what change to the scenario would create issue(s)?


### How would handle the ethical issues in the situation?
1/100 is a very high enough rate in terms of plurality voting. I would speak out to my manager based
on pre-rehearsed line. I will appeal to them based on two grounds. First, the product's defect can
have serious outcomes because it is integrated into the infrastructure. Second, providing the 
defective voting machine to the government might negatively affect the company's reputation and
future contracts.

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)


* 1.2 Avoid harm.
  * Defective machines might harm the democratic process
* 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.
  * Speaking out to my superiors is being honest and trustworthy


* 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
  * If the company releases the voting machine without fixing the issue, they violate this rule.
* 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
  * I need to review the code of the voting machine if the company decide to delay the release.
* 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.
  * The voting machine now is defective and can't be considered secure.

* 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.
  * The voting machine the company makes is integrated into the infrastructure of society. Extra care
  must be taken to make sure it isn't skewed.

### Useful GVV Pillars (and why)

* Purpose
  * By bringing up I am a programmer working on the project and therefore responsible for pointing 
  out the problems is a useful argument.
* Voice
  * I need to report the defect to my superiors.
* Reasons & Rationalizations
  * By reasoning from both an ethical perspective and from how it may affect the company, I can make
  my voice more persuasive
