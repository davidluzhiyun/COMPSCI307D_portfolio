## Scenario #1: Automated Active Response Weaponry

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues


### CARE Process

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * Q Industries might be able to earn more from contracts.
  * It might become easier for some institutions to exert control.
  * Some of the people benefiting from the status quo might enjoy cheaper stability.
  * It will become harder for people suffering from the status quo to voice their dissent through 
peaceful means.
  * Q will have several new positions open
  * Q's public image may become worse if the engineers speak out
  * The engineers will face legal action from Q
* ANALYZE the situationâ€™s details
  * Q industries and it's shareholders wish to maximize their profit through giving the new system
lethal capabilities.
  * The engineers that left Q industries wish that their jobs don't involve things too unethical.
  * Clients of Q wish to have more effective means of crowd control or power projection.
  * The engineers that left Q have the obligation to abide by the companies confidentiality code
  * Ethically the engineers have the obligation to ensure their work benefit humanity.
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * Q industries have the obligation to fulfill their agreement with their clients.
  * The engineers have two conflicting moral obligations to fulfill.
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * The engineers have two options, leave and speaking out or remain silent and keep working.
The former violates 1.7 but upholds many other codes the latter violates. There for the former is 
the better option

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
  * Q industries violate principle 1.1 by developing potentially lethal automated weapon that can
  be used to harm freedom of expression or impose racial segregation.
* 1.2 Avoid harm.
  * While some believe code 1.2 is in effect because Q's system is causing unintended harm, I
believe that Q industries is aware of the additional harm, making it intended. This therefore
complies with 1.2

* 1.7 Honor confidentiality.
  * The engineers violated 1.7 by exposing confidential information

* 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
* 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
  * The engineers upheld the two by speaking out in public

* 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
  * It can be argued that the engineers didn't uphold this principle by working for Q. But it can
also be argued that the engineers used to believe their work was for good.
