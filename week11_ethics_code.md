## Scenario #1: Automated Active Response Weaponry

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues


### CARE Process

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * Q Industries might be able to earn more from contracts.
  * It might become easier for some institutions to exert control.
  * Some of the people benefiting from the status quo might enjoy cheaper stability.
  * It will become harder for people suffering from the status quo to voice their dissent through 
peaceful means.
  * Q will have several new positions open
  * Q's public image may become worse if the engineers speak out
  * The engineers will face legal action from Q
* ANALYZE the situationâ€™s details
  * Q industries and it's shareholders wish to maximize their profit through giving the new system
lethal capabilities.
  * The engineers that left Q industries wish that their jobs don't involve things too unethical.
  * Clients of Q wish to have more effective means of crowd control or power projection.
  * The engineers that left Q have the obligation to abide by the companies confidentiality code
  * Ethically the engineers have the obligation to ensure their work benefit humanity.
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * Q industries have the obligation to fulfill their agreement with their clients.
  * The engineers have two conflicting moral obligations to fulfill.
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * The engineers have two options, leave and speaking out or remain silent and keep working.
The former violates 1.7 but upholds many other codes the latter violates. There for the former is 
the better option

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
  * Q industries violate principle 1.1 by developing potentially lethal automated weapon that can
  be used to harm freedom of expression or impose racial segregation.
* 1.2 Avoid harm.
  * While some believe code 1.2 is in effect because Q's system is causing unintended harm, I
believe that Q industries is aware of the additional harm, making it intended. This therefore
complies with 1.2

* 1.7 Honor confidentiality.
  * The engineers violated 1.7 by exposing confidential information

* 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
* 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
  * The engineers upheld the two by speaking out in public

* 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
  * It can be argued that the engineers didn't uphold this principle by working for Q. But it can
also be argued that the engineers used to believe their work was for good.


### Additional Thoughts
In real life such systems has already been employed by the israeli government to impose their policies
of apartheid and settler colonialism.


## Scenario #2

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues


### CARE Process Malicious Inputs to Content Filters

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * The activist group can still indoctrinate children with their view through the already polluted
  model.
  * Blocker Plus might become less or more popular because it's known bias.
  * The children might grow up with a biased world view.
  * Similar activist groups might try the same tactic again due to its success 
* ANALYZE the situationâ€™s details
  * If Blocker Plus switch back to an older model
    * It might be able to thwart the groups plan to indoctrinate children more effectively
    * Blocker Plus will get into legal trouble due to inability to block certain content
  * if Block Plus keep the current model and just ban certain users
    * It won't likely get into legal problem due to CIPA.
    * It might get into problems due to the biased model
    * It might make the children biased since the eventual correction might take a bit of time
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * Blocker Plus has the obligation to comply with CIPA.
  * Either option could have negative effect on children
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * Ethically the best action might be to row back to the older model, because using the new model 
violates 1.4 and 2.5 and 3.7. Legally keep going with the current model and hope for it to be fixed
is the safest.

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* 1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate. 
  * By continued using the current system, blocker plus is discriminating minority groups through
inaction

* 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
* 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
* 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.
* 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
  * By not communicating the limitations of the system of their system to the public and the 
  careless use of machine learning. Blocker Plus violate 2.4 to 2.7

* 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society. 
  * Blocker Plus has been integrated into the infrastructure of society. The lack of special care
  from the company has negative effect on a large population of children.

### Additional Thoughts
This might relate to a previous journal about making explainable models.


## Scenario #3 

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues


### CARE Process Malware Disruption

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * Malwares running on Rogue will no longer be operational
  * Independent web-based using Rogue will find their data gone
  * The country Rogue was based in becomes a target of digital imperialism.
* ANALYZE the situationâ€™s details
  * If no actions are taken against Rogue
    * Rogue will continue to make profit at the expense of the victims of malwares.
  * Taking down Rogue through cyberattack
    * The country Rogue is based in becomes a digital imperialism. At least according to the page,
the security software companies and the governments attacked a civilian target on foreign soil 
without any UN authorization.
    * Individual retailers relying on Rogue will be harmed
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * Rogue has the obligation to abide by their promise to customers
  * The governments involved have the obligation to abide by due process and international law.
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * Ethically, taking down Rogue after negotiating with the government of the country it is based in
or commence attack after UN authorization might relatively better options, but this might not happen
in time.


### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
* 1.2 Avoid harm.
  * Rogue profit from providing service to malware, violating 1.1 and 1.2. The attackers caused 
collateral damage on individual retailers, violating 1.2.
* 1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
  * Attackers showed little respect to the sovereignty of the country Rogue is based in, violating
  1.4

* 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
  * The attackers accessed the resources of Rogue. While it can be argued that they are compelled
by public good, there isn't enough information to be sure of that 

* 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
  * Judge by its promise to provide service no matter what, Rogue's central concern is likely profit,
violating 3.1


### Additional Thoughts




## Response to using the Code
The Code give care not only to the harm intended by programs, but also to the
uncontrollable consequences of programs released or harm caused by carelessness.
However, exactly because the Code attempt to be all-encompassing, sometimes multiple codes might
be in conflict. This often happens between principles regarding professional ethic and moral
consequences.
Despite its problems, the comprehensiveness of the Code is very impressive and will definitely make
my think about the implications of my intended profession.


## Response to the quote about releasing software is an uncontrolled experiment
First, when software released, there can be countless ways people copy, spread, and modify the content.
The original programmers don't have much control over how it is used.
Second, the programmers have no control over user input. This may break the software in unexpected
ways or cause security issues.
