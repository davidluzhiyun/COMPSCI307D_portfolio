## Looking Back

### Practice of coding

#### What are three things you think about differently when coding because of this course?

* Repeated Code

* Classes

* Constants


#### What is a coding habit you have changed for the better because of this course?
I start to avoid repeated code more.

#### What Breakout Game functionality did you feel was made easier to implement by the code's design and why?

* Power-up

* By making bricks a class it is easier to manage the activation of power-ups




### Design issue
Whether to have Ball.java handle what happens to the ball after collision 
#### What trade-offs were you considering?
Have Ball.java handle what happens to the ball after collision seems more natural
and clear-cut but will make Ball.java messy. 

#### What alternatives did you consider?
Have each object handle what happen to the ball. All of them must take the ball as input in a method, but the code
is clearer when the ball has diverse behaviors.

#### Why did you make the final decision you did?
I have each object handle what happen to the ball. It makes all classes very active rather
than making the Ball class a lot longer than other classes.


### Actively working to improve

#### What is a coding habit you are still working on changing?
I am still working to change the habit of using "git add ." and the way I use
inheritance.

#### What part(s) of the code did you spend the most time on?
I spent most time refactoring. Second to that was implementing Power Up

#### What is something not yet addressed that you want to know more about or do better?
1. The work flow for working on a feature that require the collaboration between several
classes
2. How JavaFX stages work. This has cause the mysterious speeding bug for my game.


### Transition Feelings

#### How has the act of refactoring your code felt?
* It made me think clearer about my coded and made it easier to add on it.
* By refactoring my code for breakout, all the long and step methods became a series
of short and understandable interaction between objects. It also became easier to
implement power up and level switching


#### How did it feel to have your code reviewed?
* It was mildly unconformable
* While I was reviewing my breakout game for refactoring, I constantly regret my
previous decision which have no easy fixes.


#### Have you thought about the design of a program before actually writing any code?

* Figure out how everything should interconnect was hard
* Figure out one specific feature
* It is easy to figure out how one PowerBrick should drop a power up. But it is hard
to plan out how all the power ups are controlled collectively in an easy to implement
way



## Looking Ahead

#### Describe a good team experience you have had. What is something about that experience you can apply to create positive teams in the future?
My team's BIO 110 collaboration. We respected each other's ideas and each did our part.
For positive future teamwork, mutual respect and clear-cut responsibilities might be
important.

#### Describe a bad team experience you have had. What is something about that experience you can apply to create positive teams in the future?
I teamed up with two girls who are friends to each other in GLOCHALL 201. They worked close together and
gave zero respect to my ideas and work. They also decided we should intentionally misinterpret
source materials for gain in debate.
For positive future teamwork, adequate interaction with ALL team members is important. 

#### What are ways people can show they respect each otherâ€™s ideas and work?
Discuss with people before modifying their work and ideas to prevent
misrepresentation.
Make your requirements clear in the first to prevent having people redo their work
for unnecessary reasons.

#### What are ways people can show they are committed to the team's success?
Complete the tasks assigned to them and come up with ideas during brainstorm session

#### What are ways people can be proactive in a team?
Come up with proposals for the project workflow and help with teammates lagging behind,

#### How can communication during meetings help or hurt your team experience?
* Help: Make sure everyone is on the same page.
* Harm: Communication might not be effective.

#### How can communication beyond meetings help or hurt your team experience?
* Help: 1 to 1 communication is sometimes more effective
* Harm: Lead to divisions that not everyone agrees. Shows little respect to the rest
of the team.

#### How can the size and timing of your GIT commits help or hurt your team experience?
* Large, infrequent commits prone to cause version conflicts.
* Smaller more frequent commits leave time for discussion and adjustments.
