## Ethics Essay

### Personally helped by computing technology
During 2021, technologies like the Health Code greatly helped with
the Covid-19 control effort in China. Due to the success in disease
control, I was able to watch the Pixar movie Soul, which was available in US only
through streaming services,in 3D on the big screen.


### Personally harmed by computing technology
Me and my freshmen year roommate were personally harmed by the health
code. Due to a glitch, one function of the health code couldn't load
for him. He was virtually stuck on campus. 

For me, according to the news, there was a major information leak for the Shanghainese local Health
code and my personal info was sold on the dark web.

### Computing technology trend for society
I believe computing technology is beneficial to people in general as it expands the
ability of humanity to think, plan and organize. Some may argue that by expanding 
the ability of humans, computing technology expand the ability of human to do harm to 
each other. This is indeed true, but is not sufficient to show computing technology is 
detrimental to humanity. Many of the problems associated with computing science are
can trace their origins to structural problems that predate computing technology. Computing
technology merely creates a new context for the problems to exist in.

### Computing technology's role in ethics
This however is not to say that computing technology doesn't bring any new ethical
problems at all. One of the new problems computing technology has brought forth is 
the tracing of responsible parties. As computing technology expand or even replace human
in thinking and decision-making, it has become increasingly hard to trace responsibility.
If a drone killed a child because it has mistaken him/her as a combatant, it is hard
to pinpoint the responsibility to one specific person. Rather a huge group of people share
different level of responsibility for the incident.
