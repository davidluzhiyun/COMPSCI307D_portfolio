During 2021, technologies like the Health Code greatly helped with
the Covid-19 control effort in China. Due to the success in disease
control, I was able to watch the Pixar movie Soul, which was available in US only
through streaming services,in 3D on the big screen.

code and my personal info was sold on the dark web.
