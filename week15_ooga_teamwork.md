### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
  * I work on the model with Luyao. I was in charge of designing the api through which the model
  communicates with control. I was also in charge of implementing certain features and fixing bugs
  in the model. I am mostly satisfied with my role.
  

* Describe your team mate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction

    * Elaine Guo
      * In charge of control. Might not be satisfied because in iterations of our design, control
      either does too much or too little.

    * Hosung Kim
      * In charge of the view. He is also responsible for the event handler mechanism. I believe
      he is satisfied with his role given his enthusiasm during meetings

    * Leila Nelson
      * Also in charge of the view. I believe she is satisfied with her role

    * Luyao Wang
      * In charge of the model together with me. More precisely he is in charge of json files.
      Probably satisfied with his role given how adamant he is about his design decisions. 

* Roles beyond coding you took on and their benefit
  * Designing the api for communication between the model and control 
* Specific example of help given to a teammate
  * Helping Luyao fix code bugs due to design changes in the team.


### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction
  * When I have fixed up the bugs and got my ColorSet system working.

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead
  * When we linked everything together this week

* Describe way(s) the team has worked well
  * We communicate regularly and effectively unlike my previous team.

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
  * Sometimes despite pre-established api and discussion, members in each part might add a feature
  incompatible with it.


### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a teammate
  * I am willing to compromise when team members communicate their reasons well.

* Your biggest weakness as a teammate
  * I am busy with other courses at the same time, so I often can't contribute as much in coding.
  Also, despite my best effort, it is sometimes hard to make myself understood(whether in English 
  or in Chinese in private meetings with Luyao)

* Something you have learned about team collaboration/communication
  * It is good practice to ask for clarification or reiterate what others have said. Also, sometimes
  one have to compromise to get things moving forward.

* Specific thing you can do to ensure successful team outcomes in the future
  * I should manage time better. Also, it can be helpful if meetings are recorded for reference.
