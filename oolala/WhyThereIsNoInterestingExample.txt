Dear Sir,
I am not sure if it is due to glitches with gitlab or teamwork problems, the latest version of
our teams oolala project is broken and left many of my features unintegrated. While my code is still
there, few of the interesting features related to my code seems working. Also, the program can't
seem to load files. I tried to contact my team but mass texting broke down on my cell phone.
I will try to make up for it as soon as possible.
Yours,
Zhiyun (David) Lu
