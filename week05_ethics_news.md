# Journal : Ethical Essay

## Issue
Tech companies purposefully design their products to breakdown after a certain period
and to be hard to repair, forcing consumers to constantly consume more. (Planned 
obsolescence) In some cases, new technologies are not used to make the product better,
but used to make the product worse for consumes. For example, HP's use of chips to control
when their ink boxes "run out".

## Perspective 1
Planned obsolescence help companies to make accumulate immense wealth at the expense 
of consumer experience, humanities technological progress, and the environment.

## Perspective 2
Due to planned obsolescence, companies are able to maintain more job posts. Combined
with the increased consumption, this leads to a more healthy economy.

## Personal Analysis
Our current economic system might not be sustainable on the long run. Some acts or laws
might temporarily provide the right to maintenance, but they won't be able to solve the
conflict between Perspective 1 and Perspective 2. Continue with this, we might not thrive
or even survive as a species.

## Impact
None. As I stated in previous journal, there are plenty people with better skills waiting
to replace me. If I chose not to accept a job opportunity out of ethical concern, someone
else probably will. Also, individual effort have little to none impact on a system-wide
problem like this.
