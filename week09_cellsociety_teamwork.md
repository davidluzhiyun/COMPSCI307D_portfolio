### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
  * Starting from the second week, I started working on the model part of the project.
  My work is mainly in the package alternativeModel, not to be confused with the package
  model, which is left over code by Arman from the first week. The old model package wasn't
  removed because it seems that Arman is updating and repurposing it.
  * Currently, I am very satisfied with my role. It is a great improvement from sitting around
  asking what should I do and get barely any response. I get to practice design rules talked
  about in class.

* Describe your team mate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction

    * Arman now works on frontend and Controller/Parsing. Previously he worked on the model
  I am not sure if he is satisfied with his role

    * Ian works on parsing. I believe he is satisfied with his role as he chose his own role
  the first week.

    * Diego works on the front end. I believe he is satisfied with his role because he chose his
  role the first week,and he has been making a lot of progress.


### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction
When I finished refactoring my code last week and passed my updated test. 

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead
The second week when each of us are sure what we are working on and start making significant 
progress

* Describe way(s) the team has worked well
During the second week, we started to help each other out rather than just work on our individual
parts

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
We lack strong central coordination. During the first week, despite all the time spent discussing,
we didn't have a plan for moving forward and had trouble assigning responsibilities as almost no one
would fill out the design plan or trello page. Even now, we have trouble integrating all our 
work together

### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a team member
  * I now test my code and keep my hands off that of others without their permission.

* Your biggest weakness as a team member
  * I am often too passive and I don't have the ability to take leadership even when leadership is
  needed

* What you have learned team collaboration/communication during this project
  * Communication during team meeting might be ineffective if too much emphasis is put on
  implementation details
  * I need to be more active and seek out tasks in future teamwork

* A specific thing can you do to make team collaboration/communication more productive
  * Have a meeting agenda for team meetings to make sure we are not lost in implementation details.
