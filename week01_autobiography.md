# CompSci Autobiography
## Zhiyun (David) Lu


### I AM Statements

1. I am a procrastinator.
2. I am a bit inexperienced with programming.
3. I am persistent.
4. I am interested in computer science.
5. I am sometimes humorous.

### Why Study Computer Science
Initially, I took some Computer Science courses because my Dad, who had 
majored in Computer Science at a university that provided the best Computer
Science education in China back then, told me that Computer Science opens up
many possibilities for my future. He said that whatever I chose to do, some CS 
knowledge could help me do it better. After taking and succeeding in
several Computer Science courses, I felt interested in Computer Science. 

### Daily Programming Uses
I haven't used programming in my daily life yet, but I have used it in my 
summer research project. In one case, I wrote a short python script to help
me format and process the scanning wave signal my mentor sent me. I later
wrote some code in C while checking documentation (I didn't know C at the
time) to make the development board output the desired scanning wave signal.


In [a later project](https://sites.duke.edu/dukecdl_internal/smart-sensors-dku/), I used python to monitor [MbientLab MetaWear](https://mbientlab.com/) sensors while
sending the collected data online. Some of the libraries that I used back then had tons 
of bugs and outdated tutorials/documentations. I had to rely on the few working
demos provided to figure things out or resort to trial-and-error. 
### Favorite Programming Project
The favorite programming project I worked on was a text based RPG game for my 
COMPSCI 101 course at DKU.

### Programming Event
My worst programming experience was trying to figure out Xilinx Vivado and 
Verilog with little prior experience in FPGA for one of my summer research. 
The tutorial I found was unclear, and sometimes Vivado just stops working
with no apparent reason.

### CompSci 307 Motivation
I believe it would help me further my skills. I have no prior experience in
making GUI and isn't good at collaborating with others on code. I could have
done much more if I had these two skills during summer research.

### Planning and Designing Code
Currently, I don't do enough to pre-plan or design my code. I sometimes use
checklists to make sure I don't miss a method or two. I sometimes also use 
flowcharts to tell myself what to do in the program.

### Advice for Next Generation
I would encourage my little brother to give Computer Science a try. I would
suggest him start at an earlier age than me. However, I **am** a bit concerned
about whether this is what he truly wants or something me and [the societal
situation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-15/china-youth-jobless-rate-hits-record-20-in-july-on-covid-woes#xj4y7vzkg) force onto him.

### Societal Role of Computer Science
Computer Science is a powerful tool in dealing with societal problems. This
has been demonstrated by social projects such as [Project Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn).
When misused, on the other hand, Computer Science is also capable of great harm like in the [recent 
incident in Henan](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-bank-protest-stopped-by-health-codes-turning-red-depositors-say-2022-06-14/).
However, I believe that using Computer Science properly on a societal level
might not be within the ability or responsibility of individual Computer Scientists .

### Using Computer Science in the Future
I am not sure at this point. I haven't figured whether I will work in academia
or the industries. Also, I am not sure if I will use Computer Science as a tool
for other subjects or remain in Computer Science.
