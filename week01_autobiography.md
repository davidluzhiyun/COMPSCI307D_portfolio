# CompSci Autobiography
## Zhiyun (David) Lu


### I AM Statements

1. I am a procrastinator.
2. I am a bit inexperienced with programming.
3. I am persistent.
4. I am interested in computer science.
5. I am sometimes humorous.

### Why Study Computer Science
Initially, I took some Computer Science courses because my Dad, who had 
majored in Computer Science at a university that provided the best Computer
Science education in China back then, told me that Computer Science opens up
many possibilities for my future. He said that whatever I chose to do, some CS 
knowledge could help me do it better. After taking and succeeding in
several Computer Science courses, I felt interested in Computer Science. 

### Daily Programming Uses
I haven't used programming in my daily life yet, but I have used it in my 
summer research project. In one case, I wrote a short python script to help
me format and process the scanning wave signal my mentor sent me. I later
wrote some code in C while checking documentation (I didn't know C at the
time) to make the development board output the desired scanning wave signal.


In a later project, I used python to monitor MbientLab MetaWear sensors while
sending the collected data online. Some of the libraries that I used had tons 
of bugs and outdated tutorials/documentations. I had to rely on the few working
demos provided to figure things out or resort to trial-and-error.
