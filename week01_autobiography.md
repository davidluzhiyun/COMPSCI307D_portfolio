# CompSci Autobiography
## Zhiyun (David) Lu


### I AM Statements

1. I am a procrastinator.
2. I am a bit inexperienced with programming.
3. I am persistent.
4. I am interested in computer science.
5. I am sometimes humorous.

### Why Study Computer Science
Initially, I took some Computer Science courses because my Dad, who had 
majored in Computer Science at a university that provided the best Computer
Science education in China back then, told me that Computer Science opens up
many possibilities for my future. He said that whatever I chose to do, some CS 
knowledge could help me do it better. After taking and succeeding in
several Computer Science courses, I felt interested in Computer Science. 

### Daily Programming Uses
I haven't used programming in my daily life yet, but I have used it in my 
summer research project. In one case, I wrote a short python script to help
me format and process the scanning wave signal my mentor sent me. I later
wrote some code in C while checking documentation (I didn't know C at the
time) to make the development board output the desired scanning wave signal.


In a later project, I used python to monitor MbientLab MetaWear sensors while
sending the collected data online. Some of the libraries that I used had tons 
of bugs and outdated tutorials/documentations. I had to rely on the few working
demos provided to figure things out or resort to trial-and-error. 
### Favorite Programming Project
The favorite programming project I worked on was a text based RPG game for my 
COMPSCI 101 course at DKU.

### Programming Event
My worst programming experience was trying to figure out Xilinx Vivado and 
Verilog with little prior experience in FPGA for one of my summer research. 
The tutorial I found was unclear, and sometimes Vivado just stops working
with no apparent reason.

### CompSci 307 Motivation
I believe it would help me further my skills. I have no prior experience in
making GUI and isn't good at collaborating with others on code. I could have
done much more if I had these two skills during summer research.

### Planning and Designing Code
Currently, I don't do enough to pre-plan or design my code. I sometimes use
checklists to make sure I don't miss a method or two. I sometimes also use 
flowcharts to tell myself what to do in the program.

### Advice for Next Generation
I would encourage my little brother to give Computer Science a try. I would
suggest him start at an earlier age than me. However, I **am** a bit concerned
about whether this is what he truly wants or something me and the societal
situation force onto him.
